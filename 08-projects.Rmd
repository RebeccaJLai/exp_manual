# Projects: Making your study go! {#projs}

## Overview

In order to make your study available for completion you need to be able to put the entire thing into something called a "project". This will give it a URL for you to direct potential participants to and mean that your supervisor can make it active- essentially switch it on.

## Creating a New Project

Navigate to the researcher's page using the menu on the right-hand side of the page. You will then be taken to a page where you can select "Projects":

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_1.png)</center>

After clicking "Projects" you will be taken to a page with all your currently saved projects, with the option to start a new project by pressing a button at the top of the page, as shown here:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_2.png)</center>

After this you will be taken to the new project information page.

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_3.png)</center>

Just like any other component or set, you will need to set the information for the project. The following information is required: 

*	**Name for participants**: This is the name that will be displayed to the participants when they click on your link, but also the name that appears on the "Studies" page that registered can access. Ensure that it is informative and appropriate.
*	**Name for researchers**: this is the name that will be displayed to other researchers. Ensure that it is informative and appropriate.
*	**URL**: this allows you to set the last part of the URL (the link) that you can disseminate to potential participants. It will be automatically stuck on to the rest of the site's address and you will be given the full address below the URL box, as shown in the image below. The text you enter here should be unique from other projects on the site. You will be told if the text you have entered is available:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_4.png)</center>

- **Contact Email**: this is the email address of the person who will be responsible for participant contact/queries. It will be displayed to participants at the end of the project. If left blank this will default to the registered email address of the researcher who created/owns the project.
- **Blurb**: this is a short description of your study that will be displayed to potential participants on the "Studies" page that registered users can access. Ensure that it is informative, appropriate and concise to prevent taking up too much space on the page.
- **Intro**: This is the information about the project. This is typically where you would place the information sheet for the study. It can be formatted with Markdown or HTML tags. If you use HTML tags, ensure that your opening and closing tags are matched to prevent data recording errors.
- **Debrief**: this is text entry form for the insertion of your debriefing text. If you leave this blank then the feedback from the next highest component will be used. This way you can have different debriefings according to what section of your study your participants have completed. See [debriefing](#debrief) for more information on what feedback panel will be displayed to participants.
- **Show to**: Gender identity-based limitations. If you are planning to use anonymous participation you should not place limitations here.
- **Age limits**: age range-based limitations. If you are planning to use anonymous participation you should not place limitations here.
- **Labnotes**: These notes inform your future self, your supervisor and admins about your study. Ensure that you fill this in and that it is informative and appropriate.

## Viewing and Editing Existing Projects

Navigate to the researcher's page using the menu on the right-hand side of the page. You will then be taken to a page where you can select "Projects":

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_1.png)</center>

After clicking "Projects" you will be taken to a page with all your currently saved projects. Alternatively you can click in the rectangle in the projects button and type in the project number.

## Adding Sets and Components

Just as in the sets, you will add items to your project from the project information page. Typically, you will be looking to insert sets into the project but you can add individual components if required.

You can search for what you are looking to insert by clicking the appropriate button next to "View Items" and either searching by the number assigned to that item or the "name for researchers" that you assigned it by typing in the search box.

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_6.png)</center>

Click the option from the available components list on the left-hand side to move it into your project. 

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_7.png)</center>

You can also remove items by double-clicking it in the project list on the left.

### Component Statuses {-}

This page also allows you to see the current status of the items you can place in your project. The green A relates to items which are active, and the red T denotes those which are still in test mode and unavailable to participants:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_8.png)</center>

### Filtering Participants Using Sets {- #filtering}

```{block, type = "info"}
It is not currently possible to filter participants in studies using any sort of server-side calculations, such as a calculated score from a screening questionnaire.
```

At the moment the only filtering tool is based on placing more than one set/superset within a project and allowing participants to self-select to a category.

In most cases we would contain all components/sets within one superset and placing that set into the project. This allows for one single path for the participants to take.

In some circumstances you might want to examine the difference between two different categories of participants who need to be assigned to specific branches of a study based on their characteristics. 

For example, imagine I want to examine what people find attractive in potential partners. I want to also examine the motivations of those who are using dating apps- not all people seeking romantic partners will use dating apps!

I could create one study with all components and ask those who do not use dating apps to skip the questions that do not apply to them. 

I could also create a set for each type of user (dating app users versus non-users) with an added component asking about dating app users motivations only into the set for dating app users. I can then place two sets into the project, allowing the participants to self-select between the two branches:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_13.png)</center>

This is what the choice will look like to the participants:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_12.png)</center>

This is likely to be of limited use to most people running studies through the site, but the option is available for those who might find it useful.

### Icons {-}

Unlike sets, your project information page has a button labeled "Icons". You can use this to assign small icons to things in your set. Here I have searched for a clipart of a beaker, and I can drag that image tile to the set I want to assign it to:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_9.png)</center>

After I have dragged it across the image will be assigned to that set:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_10.png)</center>

When participants enter your study, the set will be assigned that clip art:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_11.png)</center>

When you place your items in the project and participants navigate to it, they will see a button for each item within your project. In most cases this will only be a single button instead of the two shown here.

## Debriefs 

Debriefing information should be put in the feedback tab of the top-most set of the project. See the sections in [Planning Your Study](#debrief) for more information.

## Project URLs

In order for participants to access your study you will need to provide them with a URL suffix (a web link/address).

Each URL needs to be unique. For Experimentum, full URLs usually follow a set pattern (where XXXXX is a suffix that you assign to your project):

<center>**exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project?XXXXX**</center><p>

This URL suffix is set in the project information page in the URL box:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_3.png)</center>

```{block, type = "warning"} 
In order for your project to be accessible you should enter **only** the URL suffix in the URL box, omitting the "exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project?" part. 
```

Specify the suffix in the box labeled URL. It should not contain special characters, so you can see here where I would have a space I have placed an underscore:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_14.png)</center>

The text underneath indicates if your chosen suffix is available. 

The suffix does not need to be anything specific, but it should be appropriate for public display.

```{block, type = "info"}
This full URL will be what you share with potential participant- **exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project?XXXXX**.

If you wish to enable anonymous participation there are further additions that need to be made. These are discussed in the section about [anonymous participation](#anon).
```

## Project Structure {#project_structure}

See the section on [planning your project](#planning) on how to plan and implement the structure of your project.

You should test the structure of your study using the methods discussed below to satisfy yourself that the presentation is exactly as you expect.

## Testing Your Study {#testingyourstudy}

Before you ask your supervisor to activate your project it is important to test it extensively. There are a number of ways that you should do this.

### Examining Structure

#### Participant View {- #participant_view}

It is important that you test your study from the viewpoint of a participant. You can do this by navigating to the project information and pressing the "Go" button at the top of the page:

<center>![](images/screenshots/proj_15.png)</center>

This will run you through your study as if you were a participant. It will also generate test data which will allow you to examine the output, ensure that you can interpret the data before you run your project with real participants and allow you to remove test data easily.

```{block, type = "warning"}
You should download and retain test data before your project is activated. This will allow you to filter out the test data from the real data easily at the analysis stage.
```

It is also possible to recruit people to help you test your project- we all know that an extra pair or few pairs of eyes can more readily spot problems.

You can do this by using the **&test** URL suffix specified in the [participation](#anon) section of the page further down.

By copying the "Test" URL and sending it to testers, they will be able to access your project (including non-activated sections) for testing.

Active sections of your study will be surrounded by white, and inactive sections will be surrounded by yellow:

<center>![](images/screenshots/test_borders.png)</center>

Any data that they render using a test account will be marked as test and should be excluded from your data analysis as specified in the [data](#test_data) section of this manual.

#### Info Page View {-}

As in sets you can work out the structure of the study by looking at the project info page. 

You can see how to do this in the [testing your study](#info_page_structure) section of the sets page.

#### Sample Order {-}

As in sets, you can also use sample order to examine how the participants will progress through your study by examining a "sample order" of the components. 

You can see how to do this and interpret the output in the [sample order](#sample_order) section of the sets page.

## Activating Projects

When you create your study it will be in "test" mode. This allows you to see it, make changes and test it, but prevents participants from seeing it and doing it.

For "student" researcher accounts you will need to ask your supervisor to activate the study for you. Before you do so, please use the checklist below to ensure that you are not wasting your supervisor's time.

For researcher accounts, check and follow the guidance given in [the supervisor cheatsheet](#activating) on this topic.

```{block, type = "warning"}
Once your study is active it cannot be edited without resetting it back to "test" status, essentially deactivating it.

Students should confirm that they are completely happy with the study before they ask their supervisor to activate it. This is why the checklist above has been provided. Supervisors have been made aware of this checklist.

When a you attempt to edit an active item this warning is displayed at the top of the page next to the "Save" button:

<center>![](images/screenshots/editwarning.png)</center>

If you deactivate your study in this way, even for a minor change, it is **your supervisor's responsibility to reactivate it**. 

You may wish to check that the edits made have not impacted the validity or quality of the project, or how comparable data before and after the changes are.
```

### "Is my study ready?": Student Checklist {#checlist}

Before you ask your supervisor to turn the study status to “active”, please ensure that you have done the following:

1.	Checked spelling and grammar across all components and sets and the project.
2.	Checked the stimuli presentation is correct and as expected within all components.
3.	Tested the order of presentation of components, including debrief/feedback using the test button outlined in the section [“Testing Your Study”](#testingyourstudy). 
4.	Run through your study (multiple times) as if you were a participant.
5.	Examined the test run data to ensure that you are getting exactly what you expect and that you can successfully interpret it.
6.	Saved a copy of your test data so that you can later exclude it, separating the test data from the real data.

```{block, type = "info"}
Do not ask admins to activate your study. This is something that your supervisor does for you. They must be able to check the validity and quality of the study you have created before they allow you to start collecting data.
```

The process of activating studies is outlined in the supervisor page under the heading ["Activating Studies"](#activating)

## Advertising Your Project on the Subject Pool

You can advertise your study on the subject pool if you are a staff or student researcher at the University of Glasgow Institute of Neuroscience and School of Psychology (INSoP).

Advertisements are constructed through the [INSoP Intranet](https://intranet.psy.gla.ac.uk/). 

<center>![](images/screenshots/vpn.png)</center>

To access the Intranet off-campus you must use the VPN. See the [IT Services page on the VPN](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/it/vpn/).

Technical issues in using the VPN should be dealt with through the [IT Helpdesk](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/it/helpdesk/), not Experimentum Admin.

### Make sure your ethics has been approved.

This will change the layout and content of the ‘Dissertation’ section where you previously submitted your ethics documents to be approved.

### On the Psychology Intranet, go to the ‘Dissertation’ section

This will take you to the new Dissertation page for advertising your study to the Level 1 students in the Psychology Subject-Pool.

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_1.png)</center>

You will be able to require certain gender identities here:

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_2.png)</center>

And the required age range by dragging the cursor over the age range section:

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_3.png) </center>

```{block, type = "warning"}
The gender and age limitations set on the subject pool will determine who can see the advert on the subject pool only and do not have any impact on who can take part in the project. 

If the link is made available elsewhere, or if participants send the link to others, people outside your desired range will still be able to access the Experimentum project.
```

Next is the "Edit advert" button, which will take you to the advert editor shown below: 

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_4.png)</center>

Below this you will see the advert status. This tells you if your advert is active or not. 

Once you select online, the advert becomes active and automatically enters the Psychology Subject-Pool. The day your advert becomes active also appears on the right in red. 

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_5.png)</center>

### Editing Your Advert

Once you click Edit Advert, an information page will pop up on your screen like this:

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_6.png)</center>

The code at the bottom of the screen tells you what to write in each section of the advert. You will require the following information:

*	**Project Title**: this is where you enter the title of your project, which may or may not be the same as your advertised title.

*	**Advertised Title**: this is the title that participants will see in the Subject-Pool.

*	**Advert**: this is where you create your recruitment message. This must contain a live link to the Experimentum project for automatic credit assignment to work. Do this by using HTML:

```{block, type = "info"} 

Use HTML to provide a live link.

`<a href="https://www.google.com">Click this for Google</a>`
        
Replace the ‘https://www.google.com’ with one of the URL’s to your project which is found on your Project Information section on Experimentum in the Projects tab.
        
<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_7.png)</center>
        
Replace "Click this for Google" with an appropriate display text.
```


*	**Duration**: you can select the duration of your project in set time-blocks on the left or a more specific time on the right where you manually enter the duration of your project.

*	**Payment**: for Level 4 Dissertation Projects, you will not be required to give payment to participants, so this section remains blank. 

```{block, type = "info"}
Note: Do NOT put participation credits in the "payment" section. Credits have their own section.
```

*	**Credits**: this is where you select the number of credits to award the Level 1 students who complete your study. Credits can be automatically assigned to participants upon completion of your project. See [Participation Credits](#credits) below for more info.

*	**Giver**: this section remains empty.

```{block, type = "info"}
All information entered into the Edit Advert section is automatically saved and, if the advert is active, automatically enters the Psychology Subject-Pool.
```

## Participation Credits {#credits}

### Automatic Assignment of Credits
 
 From 5th October 2020 participants will be able to receive participation credits automatically, provided that you have:
 
 - Posted your advertisement in the INSoP subject pool. 
 - Used the full experimentum URL (as copied from the project information page and *not* a modified URL such as a "tinyURL") in your advertisement on the subject pool.
 - The participant accesses your study whilst signed in to the subject pool, using the full experimentum URL in your subject pool advertisement.
 
The full URL is available to copy from the project page. Clicking the buttons here will copy it to your clipboard:

<center>![](images/screenshots/anon1a.png)</center> 
 
```{block, type = "warning"}
You should not place more than ONE URL in any given subject pool advert.
```
 
Please ensure that you have adequate participation credits to cover the amount of participation that you expect to receive. If you require further participation credits to be assigned to your account please speak to your supervisor.
 
When credits are allocated they will be issued in the name of the project or advert title from the subject pool:

<center>![](images/screenshots/subj_pool.png)</center> 

The "dissertation" section for L4 students is slightly different to PGR and staff in that there is only one project. Here is a screenshot from an L4 dissertation page:

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_10.png)</center>

```{block, type = "info"}
If you run out of credits to give the automatic assignment of credits will still continue despite your balance falling to 0. 

This means that your participants will still receive automatically given credits, but you will not be able to manually assign credits whilst your balance remains as 0.

Speak to your supervisor/ the webmaster if you need more credits to be added to your balance.
```

### Manual Assignment of Credits

Go to the “Credits for Dissertation” at the top of the Psychology Intranet. This section shows you how many Participation Credits you have and how many participants from the Psychology Subject-Pool have completed your study.

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_8.png)</center>

You will start off with 60 Credits to give to Level 1 students, and as participants complete your project these credits will slowly diminish.

You can manually assign credits to specific participants by searching up their Participation Key in the search box if, for example, automatic assignment does not work:

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_9.png)</center>

Underneath this is where you will find the participants who have completed your project (identified by their Participation Key):

<center>![](images/screenshots/pool_10.png)</center>

Additionally there are a number of details given about each completion through the subject pool:

*	**Date and Time**: this is the date and time they completed your project.

*	**Participation Key**: this is the key assigned to random participants to ensure anonymity and the Key you use in the search box to find a participant to manually assign credits.

*	**Credits**: shows you how many credits have been assigned to that participant. 

*	**Status**: when first complete, the status will show as ‘Pending’ due to the 2-week pending of credits to allow for refusal for some reason (but generally, this never happens). This will then change to ‘Permanent’ after the 2 weeks to signify that the students have their credits permanently.

```{block, type = "info"}
Participants do not need to do anything to change the status of the credits from pending. 

Pending credits will be accepted for the purposes of the L1 participation course requirement.
```

*	**Comments**: this shows where the participants completed your project from, in this case it will always be Experimentum. The (auto) refers the URL link you used in the advert to link participants to your project. This will change depending on the URL you use, for example, if you use the ‘Guest’ URL, it will say (guest) instead of (auto).

## Participation {#anon}

### Anonymous/Registered Participation

Different types of participation require different suffixes to be attached to the URL, which you defined in the project information page:
 
<center>![](images/screenshots/anon_1.png)</center> 

For your convenience, you do not need to add anything to the URL yourself, but rather return to the project information page and you will be presented with the following buttons:

<center>![](images/screenshots/anon1a.png)</center> 

Clicking on one of the three buttons will copy the text to the clipboard for you to paste elsewhere.
 
The different links will lead to different types of sign in pages:

- **Requires Account (no suffix)**: participants will be required to sign in to a registered account before they can proceed to the study.
- **Auto-login (ending in "&guest")**: this will take the participant to the project first page with a button to log them in as a guest.
- **Guest login (ending in "&auto")**: this will automatically log the user in as a guest and display the dialogue box asking for age and gender identity information.
- **All options (ending in "&all")**: will display 4 buttons asking the user to choose between logging in to an existing account, registering for an account and logging in as a guest.
- **Test (ending in "&test")**: creates a test login for you to test your study. Data will be marked with status "test" so that investigators can remove this data from their analyses. Will present a dialogue box asking for age and gender identity. Pressing "cancel" in this dialogue box will return you to the project login page with the suffix "&all", displaying 4 buttons with login options as specified above.

So, this means that:

- "**exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&myurl**" would require participants to sign in to an existing account or be required to create an account.

- "**exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&myurl&guest**" would display the following button asking the users to press the button to log in as a guest. When they click this button to complete the project, they will receive a dialogue box asking for age and gender identity information.

<center>![](images/screenshots/anon_2.png)</center> 
 
- "**exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&myurl&auto**" will bypass the “login as guest” button, instead they are automatically are logged in as a guest to complete the project and presented with the dialogue box asking for age and gender identity information.
 
<center>![](images/screenshots/anon_3.png)</center>  
 
- "**exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&myurl&all**" will give the users the following 4 buttons where they can make the choice to login to an existing account, register for an account or login as a guest to complete the project.

<center>![](images/screenshots/anon_4.png)</center> 

- "**exp.psy.gla.ac.uk/project&myurl&test**" will present the user with the test login dialogue box:

<center>![](images/screenshots/test_dialogue.png)</center>
