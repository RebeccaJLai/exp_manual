abstract="Faces impart exhaustive information about their bearers, and are widely used as stimuli in psychological research. Yet many extant facial stimulus sets have substantially less detail than faces encountered in real life. In this paper, we describe a new database of facial stimuli, the Multi-Racial Mega-Resolution database (MR2). The MR2 includes 74 extremely high resolution images of European, African, and East Asian faces. This database provides a high-quality, diverse, naturalistic, and well-controlled facial image set for use in research. The MR2 is available under a Creative Commons license, and may be accessed online.",

journal="Canadian Journal of Psychology",
year="1957",
volume="11",
number="1",
pages="21--21",
abstract="To study the effects of time and multiple visual fixations upon closure, incomplete human faces were projected with: (1) ample time and the opportunity for multiple fixations; (2) ample time and only one fixation; and (3) only a single glimpse afforded. Perceptual performance did not differ significantly under these conditions, and it was concluded that neither viewing time nor eye-movements contribute to the perception of familiar objects.
