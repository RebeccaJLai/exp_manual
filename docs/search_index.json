Lai, Rifah Abdullah, Gaby Mahrholz, Lisa DeBruine 2020-01-21 About Experimentum Getting Support For Experimentum @ University of Glasgow Users Currently there are two active admins available to provide support, these are Rebecca Lai and Professor Lisa DeBruine. Admins play a double role. In addition to helping you with Experimentum we are active researchers and teaching staff with additional jobs to do elsewhere. Our inboxes are often full, and emails will often go unread. As a result of this, all students and staff who are experiencing technical issues should use the Slack workspace “Experimentum-web” to get support. Additionally, we are using the queries on the slack workspace to best update the user documentation, so it is important to keep all correspondence in one neat location. You should never post data on this workspace, either in data file or screenshot form, as this would be a violation of the GDPR. All such files will be removed and your supervisor will be informed. If you need to share your data please use one of the university approved services available to you, such as OneDrive or OwnCloud. Lost Passwords For security reasons we do not allow users to request a password reset automatically. If you are any type of account holder who has lost their password, please contact the admins or your supervisor to ask for it to be reset. This request should only be honoured if sent from the email address associated with the account. A temporary password will be issued, which is case-sensitive, and should be changed as soon as possible. For accounts types which have access to participant data (student &amp; researcher), contact your supervisor or admins. Be prepared to visit with your student card to have your password reset. Changing Your Password You can change your password by signing in, navigating to “My Account” from the menu on the right of the page and clicking the link “change your password” under “Username”: Tutorial Sessions During times of particularly heavy use through the academic year we may schedule specific help sessions to deal with common issues and to help you fix specific problems that you might have. These will be advertised on the Slack workspace and on appropriate Moodle pages. If you are experiencing an issue that is particularly difficult to fix remotely, you can make an appointment with Rebecca via private message on the “Experimentum-web” workspace. However, you should have made attempts to solve the issue remotely first as time available for these appointments is extremely limited. If you require assistance to navigate this document or create your study due to disability please contact your supervisor who may refer you to the admins. For Other Users If you download and use the code for this online psychology study platform you should establish clear guidelines outlining the role of the admins and methods of support. Staff from the University of Glasgow will not provide support for users of other systems based upon this code. Our Slack workspace is for internal use only. If you find an issue with the Experimentum codebase, please file an issue here. If you find an issue with the codebase for this manual you can file an issue here. Privacy Notices Cookies Cookies are used for Experimentum to allow us to track user sessions, which allows participants to navigate between pages during a session without having to log in to every page. In the case of anonymous logins, the session is tracked to maintain the same identity across multiple elements of the same study. Cookies are not tracked beyond a single session, for either registered users or anonymous participants. By closing the browser, the current session is ended, and cookies tracking the session are discarded. Cookies are not used in any other way by us, and the information is not retained or shared with any other organisations. Data Management Your study’s data is your responsibility. Please ensure that it is protected and used appropriately. University of Glasgow guidelines with regard to data protection are available to view here and more general data management guidelines here. Experimentum saves your data to the University of Glasgow School of Psychology secure servers, which are on-site in Hillhead Street. Data will be output in Comma Separated Variable (.csv) files in “tidy” format and is available for download from your project or from each component of your study. Whilst data processing questions should be directed to your supervisor(s) and advisors, there are a couple of common tasks that you might find yourself needing to do. See the examples in the section Commonly used R code for help with some common code segments. About your data With all account types, besides anonymous participation, your user ID is linked to the data that you submit. This allows us to track users in multi-part studies, but it also means that our servers will contain multiple bits of information about you built up through your participation. Individual researchers will only be able to access the data that you submit on their studies, and not data you submit to studies belonging to other researchers. In real terms, this means that individual researchers will only see the data that you give to them, not the data that you give across the entire site. In cases where you participate in multiple studies for the same researcher, they will be able to see your data across these studies. Individual researchers are responsible for the protection of your privacy, ensuring that there is no way for any third party to use this information to “triangulate” your identity using the information you have provided. If you have any concerns about how your data is used please contact the researchers involved in the study or studies that you are taking/have taken part in. To see the University’s guidelines on how researchers should treat data see here. You have rights concerning your own data and how it is used, and responsible researchers should always hold these in the highest regard. Consent Upon registration, users are asked to complete a standardised consent form: When constructing studies, you should also include your own consent form, including all relevant information specified by your supervisor(s) and regulatory body relevant to your work. Codebase Open code for the site and installation instructions are available to download here. This is provided under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. The same is provided for this user guide here, and under this same license. This document was authored using bookdown (Xie 2019).

["accounts.html", "Chapter 2 User Accounts 2.1 Overview 2.2 Account Types 2.3 Registration Process 2.4 Requesting Researcher Status 2.5 Checking your account status 2.6 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests", " Chapter 2 User Accounts 2.1 Overview There are several account types that you can have with Experimentum, each with its own purpose and different levels of privileges. This chapter explains what account types exist, what they do, which type of account you might want to have and how to change account types for supervisors. 2.2 Account Types 2.2.1 “Guest” Accounts For participants who are not required to have an account. You do not need to be signed in but you can still take part in some experiments on the site. When you close your browser, this account is discarded and no longer tracked. This allows for anonymous participation in some experiments. If a guest participant closes their browser mid-way through a study their progress will not be saved and the data will read as an incomplete run. As guest users do not have a profile, we do not store their age, gender or any other types of information about them. We suggest that you do not place age or gender restrictions on studies where participants take part anonymously as guests. When guests sign into a study with age or gender restrictions, they will see a dialogue box asking them for their age and gender. This information is used to prevent those who should not take part from taking part and inserted into the user information in the downloaded data files. If you need to collect further demographic information, we suggest constructing a demographics questionnaire component. 2.2.2 “Registered” Accounts These accounts are for participants. You have created an account and given us your date of birth and gender identification. You can participate in studies on the site. Your participation record is tracked, meaning that you can be linked across multiple-part studies. Under no circumstances should you be linked across multiple studies without your explicit permission, we will never use data to “triangulate” your identity. Researchers can only access your data from their own studies, not the studies of other researchers. 2.2.3 “Student” Accounts For students who are conducting research as part of a mini project, undergraduate dissertation, master’s or doctoral thesis. To create and run studies you must first register and then request researcher status. Your supervisor will be the person who changes your account status and you can check the status of your account by looking at your account info. When approved, students will be given “student” status, a special type of research account. You may still use this account to participate in experiments, but we advise setting up a separate registered, non-research account for participation to prevent serious data submissions from being removed by other investigators. 2.2.4 “Researcher” Accounts For staff, more senior students and anyone who may be supervising students using Experimentum. Follow the instructions for students as above, but staff should set either Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as their supervisor, who will grant them “researcher” status. If you plan on supervising students using Experimentum you should set up a researcher account to be able to oversee the construction of their studies, share components and change studies to “active” before data collection can begin. When you have established your researcher account your name will appear in the list of potential supervisors for students to choose from. 2.2.5 “Test” Accounts For students and staff. This account type gives you the same amount of privileges as the registered account for participants, but any data collected from these accounts is saved in data sets with a status of “test”. This allows you and other test accounts to try out your study and easily identify and filter out which data should be excluded from the analysis. If you wish to have a test account contact an admin to set this up. 2.2.6 “Admin” Accounts For staff who assist others constructing and managing their studies online. This is the highest level of access. An admin account basically allows us to “supervise” all users, including researcher accounts. We use this to see what is happening when problems arise to help provide aid, not to take responsibility for approval of status changes of students or oversee the design or activation of studies. 2.3 Registration Process In order to sign up to the site you will select “Sign up” on the top right-hand side of the page. Once there you will be taken to a new page as below and asked to create a username, set a password and confirm it, provide your gender identity and birthday. Completing these steps alone will create a “registered” account type. With this account type you can participate in studies on the site. Your participation record is tracked, meaning that you can be linked across multiple-part studies. Under no circumstances will you be linked across multiple studies without your explicit permission and we will never use data to “triangulate” your identity. Researchers and students can only access your data from their own studies, not the studies of others. 2.4 Requesting Researcher Status If you are a researcher or a student who is using the site to conduct a research project (such as a mini or maxi project, or an MSc or PhD thesis) you will need to request permission to construct and conduct studies. If you are a supervising member of teaching staff, you will also need to have an account in order to supervise your students project. On the registration page, or the account page if you have already registered, there is a “Request Researcher Status” button. When you click on this additional fields will appear that you will need to fill in, as below. You will need to provide us with your name, your email address and your supervisor. You should use your university email address to sign up and provide your real name so that your supervisor can more easily identify you. If you are a student conducting a research project you should select the member of staff supervising your project from the drop-down menu of supervisors. If you are a supervising member of teaching or research staff, you should request Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as your supervisor. If you are a more senior student who is relatively self-sufficient or you have supervising duties of your own, and your supervisor agrees to it, you can also request Lisa or Rebecca as your supervisor, and we will set you as a “researcher” account type. As a general rule, all students completing a research project should be assigned “student” status. Some PhD students may be better off with “researcher” status. Such individuals should speak to their supervisors and the admins to determine which is the best account type for them. 2.5 Checking your account status When you first sign up your account will be the “registered” type and will remain as such until your researcher status is approved. You can check on the status of your account by selecting “account” from the menu on the right-hand side of the page. Underneath the “My Information” section of the page will tell you your date of registration, number of logins and current account type. The menu on the right also changes when you have been granted researcher status, with a new option of “Researchers” available which takes you to the study creation area of the site. If there is a delay in accepting your request you should contact your supervisor directly and not the admin staff. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to make changes to your access level. If your supervisor is experiencing technical difficulties in accepting your request, they should contact the admins directly themselves. Admins will not respond to a student who is requesting help on behalf of their supervisor. 2.6 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that their students have the status that they require to carry out their projects. This includes assigning them sufficient permissions to construct and deploy their studies. Once the supervisor has “researcher” status they will have a new area of the website opened to them, accessible through the researchers’ link in the menu on the right, which will contain a section called “Admin”: Clicking on this button will take them to a page with more options. To see and make changes to the privileges of those who have requested you as a supervisor and requested researcher status select the option “Supervision” from the menu. Here you will see a list of individuals who have requested you as a supervisor. To change their status, select the appropriate account type from the right-most drop-down menu under the column “Status”. The account you are making changes to will have to log out and back in again to be updated with their new permissions. When you press “Send” an email will be sent to the student to inform them of the status change. "],
["stimuli.html", "Chapter 3 Stimuli 3.1 Overview 3.2 Accepted File Formats 3.3 Naming Conventions 3.4 Pre-Processing 3.5 Uploading Stimuli 3.6 Using Stimuli", " Chapter 3 Stimuli 3.1 Overview This chapter will cover how to upload your own stimuli, tips on naming conventions for the easiest possible way to assign stimuli to trials, accepted file formats and a rough guide to how to convert to the required formats. Remember that not all image, video and audio files are free for use. Check the license and terms of use of the images before you save, edit or copy and paste them. 3.2 Accepted File Formats Experimentum uses what we hope to be the most universally applicable file formats to deliver your study. These are the file formats that can be successfully displayed through the site. Please ensure that you conform to these types as others may not be tolerated by the system. Stimuli Type Accepted Formats Images JPEG, GIF and PNG Audio MP3 Video M4V 3.3 Naming Conventions In order to make the process of assigning stimuli to trials as easy as possible it is recommended that you establish a systematic way of assigning names to files. The stage of assigning stimuli to trials goes much faster and smoother if you can search for the stimuli files names using some sort of common text string in the names of the files. ****** more info and a working example is required. 3.4 Pre-Processing In order to get your stimuli up with the minimal amount of fuss, please ensure that you do any required pre-processing. 3.4.1 Images Images should be of uniform size and of the correct file formats before uploading. Converting Images GNU Image Manipulation Program (“GIMP”, The GIMP Development Team 2019) is a free software that allows you to modify and export image files to a variety of file formats. This software was developed as a free and open source equivalent to photo-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop and can achieve very complex tasks. However, there are only 3 basic operations that you should be able to perform in GIMP order to convert your images to the correct formats. More complex operations are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but there are plenty of resources online should you choose to want to look them up. If there are any further instructions that would prove helpful please file an issue here describing what you want me to include in future versions of the manual. Importing Images There are a number of ways that you can import images into GIMP. File &gt; Open This is the simplest way to open an image file in GIMP. Open the software first from your Start Menu or Launchpad. Then click on File &gt; Open… ***** image in here A dialogue box will appear from which you can navigate to the location of the file you are attempting to open and select it. Click Open and the file will appear in a new tab. ***** image in here “Open With” If you already have the image file saved on your PC, you can navigate to the file’s location through your file explorer or finder and right click on it. Select “Open With” in the menu that pops up. This will open the GIMP GUI and should open a new tab with that image inside it. On some machines GIMP will not be automatically recognised as a type of software associated with image files. In this case you will need to select “Choose another app” and navigate to the executable file for GIMP (location may vary depending on machine and operating system type). It is not advisable to permanently change all image files to be associated with GIMP, as the software can run slowly and sometimes you only want to view an image in a photo browser, not edit it. Edit &gt; Paste as… &gt; New Image Finally, if the image file is not saved on your computer you can copy it to the clipboard and paste it directly into GIMP. Do this by going to Edit &gt; Paste as… &gt; New Image. This will create a new image in GIMP that is not yet saved. I recommend saving immediately in the first instance and periodically thereafter. GIMP File Format The file extension of files created in GIMP will be .xcf. These types of files allow for saving of image layers and text path information, allowing you to have an image made of multiple layers and with text that can be edited at a later point. Saving images with layers and text path information could come in handy if you are generating your own image stimuli which features small changes (such as different words), but remains mostly the same (same background colour, size, fonts, etc). In this case you could save a layer or export a different .GIF, .JPG or .PNG from the same .XCF file for each change that you need to make. Changing Image Size Images that are too large can be resized in the &lt;img&gt; html tag to fit into a smaller space but if your image is too large you could be using more memory than would be required to store your images on the server. This may have a knock on effect in the stimuli loading times. Rather than consume excess bandwidth it is adviable to size the images down prior to uploading them on to the server. To resize the image (and all layers and items contained within) click on the menu Image and press “Scale Image…”. This dialoue box will come up: The image size defaults to px, or pixels. The height and the weight are by default linked together (as demonstrated by the chain symbol to the right of the two boxes). When linked changing either the height or the width will keep the image to the same aspect ratio (the proportions of the sizes). You may unlink the aspect ratio by clicking on the chain. When unlinked the chain will appear as broken. Linking these helps you avoid distortion that might happen if you resize one dimension only, which might elongate/shorten the other dimension and make it look funny. It also allows you to make images to fit in a specific space in your study. For example, this word completion task where images are used instead of text: I have used images in the question field of a mixed questionnaire, as the blank spaces are more apparent to the participants. I have also limited their size to 25px to ensure that they do not seem too oversized in comparison to the text entry fields next to them. Exporting Images GIMP is capable of exporting GIF, JPEG and PNG file formats. To export your image go to File &gt; Export As. You will then be asked to enter a file name in the text box at the top of the dialogue box that opens up. You can specify the type of file by typing the file extension at the end of the file name, “.gif”, “.jpg” or “.png” for each of the aforementioned file types respectively. Once you have done this, press the “export” button at the bottom of the dialogue box. You may be asked to specify compression options after pressing the button. This is just to ask how much (if any) quality you are willing to sacrifice to save on the size of the file. This is an example from a PNG file. This image was compressed with the default options. As you can tell the quality is good, but the image is not very rich. A richer image with higher levels of variation in the pixels may do worse that this one with the same level of compression. When exporting JPEG files you will be asked to select the quality as a percentage, not compression level. The higher the percentage the higher the quality and the less compression being done. Experiment with the levels of comrpression in the image and examine the outputs carefully for any artifacts in the images resulting from the compression process. If you find the quality lacking, lower the amount of compression allowed and try again until you find the level appropriate for your images. These images are saved as JPEG, and are at 100%, 50% and 0% quality. This gives file sizes of 76KB, 9KB and 2KB respectively: The first is 100% quality, no compression. The second has minimal pixelation artifacts around the periphery of the face, neck, hair and some issues with the skin texture in places. It also seems (to my office mates and I at least) that the skin tone is a ittle yellower in image 2. Number 3 is unusable. 3.4.2 Audio Gaby will do this bit. 3.4.3 Video 3.5 Uploading Stimuli 3.6 Using Stimuli 3.6.1 Assigning Stimuli to Experimental Trials 3.6.2 Using Stimuli in Questionnaires References "],

They are made up of one or more individual components, available in 3 different types: mixed, radiopage and ranking. 5.2 New Questionnaire To create a new questionnaire, navigate to the researcher’s section of the page by using the menu on the right and selecting the questionnaires option. From here, you will be able to see the questionnaires for which you have ownership status (ones you have created yourself, or ones that someone else has shared with you). To create a new questionnaire, click the button on the top right “New Questionnaire”: The following pop-up box will appear, allowing you to choose the type that you want to create: The types that you choose will depend on what type of functionality your study requires. You should note that pencil and paper questionnaires will not always be able to be copied exactly onto Experimentum. If you make any changes to questionnaires to deliver them electronically you should discuss required changes with your supervisor to ensure their validity has not been compromised. 5.3 Save Questionnaire and Reset Buttons Once you have entered information about the questionnaire you should save it. Saving regularly is good practice. Do this by pressing the save questionnaire button. The reset button is akin to a “revert” button, where any changes made after the last save can be discarded and you return to the last saved version. The JavaScript for saving the questionnaire occasionally stops working on some browsers, so we recommend saving the questionnaire after every 3 or so changes to minimise loss of work in the event of an error. Please note that the site currently does not support version control, so once you save a change the previous version will be overwritten. 5.4 Questionnaires Information All types of questionnaires will ask you to provide information about it, the only difference will be the Questionnaire Type, which will correspond to the type of questionnaire you have chosen on the previous pop-up box. Name for Users: this is the name of this component that will be displayed to users. Please ensure that it is appropriate. Name for Researchers: this is the name of this component for researchers. It will be displayed on lists and visible to you, your supervisor and admin staff. It should be informative and appropriate. Question Order: this indicates how you want Experimentum to display the questions contained in this component only. Fixed will display the questions to the participants in the order you have put them on this page. Random will mix the order of question presentation up automatically. Order of presentation will be recorded in your data when you download it. Limited to: limitations will only allow people in a certain age range and with a certain gender identity to complete this component of the study. If you are planning on allowing anonymous participation you should not set limitations as age and gender identity of these users will be unknown and may not be allowed to do these sections of the study if participants refuse this information. Labnotes: this is a short blurb about this component of your study. You should always add lab notes so that you, your supervisor and the admins will be able to tell what this component is about. The following sections will describe each questionnaire type and what they can do. 5.5 Questionnaire Tab The questionnaire tab on the lower half of the page is different for each questionnaire. Please see the appropriate sections below for more information on these. 5.6 Feedback Tab In most cases you should leave this empty. The feedback for the top-most set is normally where you would put your debriefing information. You can see the later sections on projects and debriefing. 5.7 Adding and Deleting questions 5.7.1 Adding Individually In order to add a new question, you must ensure that all editing options are closed on the existing questions by clicking the pencil to get rid of the yellow surround or the cog to close the menu. Pressing the button at the bottom of the page will allow you to add a new question. Experimentum will add a new question by directly duplicating the previous question, with all the same text and attributes. Please ensure that you set a unique name for the new question before you attempt to save the questionnaire as questions with duplicate names will be removed by the system. The JavaScript for saving the questionnaire occasionally stops working on some browsers, so we recommend saving the questionnaire after every 3 or so changes to minimise loss of work in the event of an error. 5.7.2 Adding in Bulk It is also possible to add some types of questions in bulk by using a spreadsheet. Unfortunately, not all types are covered, but the most basic and most frequently used types are. Spreadsheet templates are available by clicking “add from spreadsheet” and selecting the underlined type of questionnaire from the options just above the buttons. Each of the column headers will relate to each of the question attributes you would use when setting the questions manually. For ranking and radiopage questionnaires not all of these headers will be applicable. Double click on the ones you do not need to remove them as I have done in the image below: Fill the template spreadsheet in and save it onto your own storage, copy the cells that contain your question information. See the section below for more about question information. Double click on the section that says, “Double-click to paste data from a spreadsheet” and paste it when in the new entry box that appears: If you do not use the template spreadsheet, but one you have made yourself, ensure that the options that you are specifying match. You can also drag the headers on the entry window from left to right to re-order them if your own spreadsheet does not match the headers here. Column Header: Refers to: Options: name dv_name (in data = q_name) Names must only contain letters, underscores and numbers (numbers must not be the first characters). question The question that you are asking the participant. Whatever you want to ask the participant. type The type of question, akin to the options selected from the menu opened by the cog * select: pulldown menu selectnum: numeric pulldown menu radio: radiobuttons radioanchor: radiobuttons with anchors datemenu: date menu text: short text options Where you would specify the response options available to the participants. Applicable to select and radio types. Numerical code, followed by “:”, and then text option. Specifying multiple by separating options using a semi-colon (;) maxlength Where you would specify the length of the response Applicable to radioanchor and text. Radioanchor: how many points in the range. Text: how many characters allowed. low_anchor Specifying the low anchor for the selected option. Applicable to selectnum, radioanchor and datemenu. Selectnum specifies the lowest number in the range of the dropdown menu Radioanchor specifies the text for low anchor Datemenu specified the lower end of the year range. high_anchor Specifying the high anchor for the selected option. Applicable to selectnum, radioanchor and datemenu. Selectnum specifies the highest number in the range of the dropdown menu Radioanchor specifies the text for high anchor Datemenu specified the higher end of the year range. 5.7.3 Deleting Questions Questions can be erased by clicking the picture of the trash/bin next to the question you want to delete. Please note that the site currently does not support version control, so once you save a change the previous version will be overwritten. This includes deleted questions- once you have saved the changes they are gone. 5.8 Questionnaire Types 5.8.1 Mixed Questionnaire Allows you to present multiple question types and gather multiple response types in a single component. When you select a mixed questionnaire, you will be taken to this page: As you can see you have the same questionnaire information section at the top, as you will have in all questionnaires. The differences lie in the types of questions that you can include. Mixed questionnaires can accommodate multiple types of questions on a single page. Instructions: when you click the part that says “Click here to set instructions” you will be able to enter text instructions to the participants for this entire component. You will also be able to enter Markdown and HTML code, which allows you to link to and embed additional media or format the text in specific ways. If you use HTML tags you must ensure that you have matching opening and closing tags, as unmatched ones will prevent the component from recording data. dv_name: this is the name of the dependent variable, the name that will be assigned to the column q_name in the downloaded data indicating which question the participant has answered. You should set one which is unique to this component and perhaps across all components. Question: clicking the part which says “click here to set your question” will allow you to enter the question text that the participants will see, the question that you want to ask them. 5.8.1.1 Changing Question and Response Type Clicking the cog next to the question and then the arrow in the resulting menu will allow you to choose the type of question you want to set. When you have selected the type of question, you can then edit the response types that can be made by the participants by clicking the pencil next to the cog. When this editing mode is active, the response section will be unfolded, and will be displayed with a yellow surround. You must close this editing mode by clicking the pencil a second time, getting rid of the yellow surround, before you add a new question, click the cog or save the questionnaire. In the section below I will cover the types of questions and information about the changes to the participant responses in the appropriate sections below. Pulldown Menu: pulldown menus give your participants a set of text option responses to choose from. Each text option has a numeric coding value associated with it, which will be the returned value in the downloaded data in place of the text. This is specified before the colon. The text options are specified after the colon, these are not returned in the data. Each text value should be associated with a unique numerical coding value, non-unique numerical codes will be deleted upon saving the questionnaire. You can add multiple options to the menu. Numeric Pulldown Menu: this allows you to set numerical values to a pulldown menu, with no associated text label. The range that is set is the range that will be displayed to the user, as below. You should use whole numbers only. Slider: sliders provide you with a way for participants to return a finer-grained numerical response on a spectrum between two anchor points. A slider scale will be displayed to participants, with the low end of the range associated with the low anchor, and the high end the high anchor. Participants will move a slider along the scale, and a numerical value associated with the position they put it in returned in the data. You set the scale limits and increments, in this example from 0 to 100 in increments of 1. You can also change the text anchors by clicking on them as shown here. Radio Buttons with Anchors: this option allows you to set a scale with a low anchor and a high anchor, which you can change by clicking the text. You can add or remove points to the scale by pressing the + and – buttons on either side of the response. On this scale example below, a number will be returned associated with the point on the scale the participant submitted, here 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest). Date Menu: date menus allow the participants to choose a specific date. You can set the range of dates to choose from, in the example below the participant is allowed to go back 100 years from the current date (-100y) but cannot go further into the future than today (+0y). When participants click on the response, they will be given a calendar to pick from, instead of typing the date. Countries: participants can choose from a list countries. Returned in the data as the two letter ISO-3166-1 code. Short Text: allows participants to enter free-response text up to and including 255 characters. Returned in the data as character strings. Long Text: allows participants to enter free-response text over 255 characters. Returned in the data as character strings. If you do not need more than 255 characters, please use the short text to minimise strain on the server. "],

["known-issues.html", "Known Issues Overview Issues…", " Known Issues Overview This is a list of issues that are known and that we are working on to fix. If you discover another issue that is not listed here you can report the issue here- but please check that it has not been reported before you open another issue for it. Issues… Which do NOT interfere with the operation of the site These issues are bugs which do not prevent the intended function of the action being carried out at the time of their occurrance and are considered to be of low priority. “The supervisor or supervised could not be found” when changing account type This happens when a supervisor attempts to change the account type of a student from “registered” to “student”. The account changes are carried out regardless of the message. To check this log out, log back in and then check the status of the student. The account being changed must log out and then back in for any changes to take effect, regardless of whether you experience this bug or not. Which DO interfere with the operation of the site These issues are bugs which in some way inhibit the function of the site and are considered high priority for fixes and workarounds. Email Notifications Email notifications are not always sent. E-mails notifying students and supervisors of changes of account type work seemingly without issue. In particular, e-mails requesting supervisors turn studies to “active” are not being sent. Workaround: Please e-mail your supervisor directly if you require them to review and activate your study. Cannot Share Ownership of Components With Students At the moment it is not possible to share components with students. This stems from a work-around regarding access to data. Anyone who is an owner of a component may download the data gathered by it, even if that component is also used by others. Workaround: At the moment it is recommended that students create their own components to suit their needs or that the supervisor duplicate the component and assign the duplicate to the student in need. If the supervisor is making a component specifically for that student and no-one else will or should have access to that data contact an admin on the Slack workspace for another workaround. "],

["supervisor-cheatsheet.html", "Supervisor Cheatsheet Overview Admins Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Activating Studies Resetting Passwords Autologin Links", " Supervisor Cheatsheet Overview This is a collection of sections from the document directed at the everyday operations that supervisors would need to carry out assembled in one place for easy reference. If there is anything missing please file an issue on the GitHub codebase for this book by clicking here. Admins Lisa is busy and Rebecca is contracted for 1 hour per week for Experimentum support. Much of the day-to-day of handling your students will fall on you, the supervisor. If you are not prepared to accept this you may need to consider using another system. Admin Responsibilities Our responsibilities are: To try to ensure smooth operation of the site with regards to technical difficulties and instruction of staff and students. We will hold workshops at specific time points throughout the academic year, update this manual and answer questions on Slack. To troubleshoot problematic issues experienced by staff and students. Supervisor Responsibilities To ensure that you have a researcher account to supervise any of your students who wish to use the site. You may be comfortable allowing some more senior and trustworthy students almost complete autonomy by granting them full researcher status but it is still advisable to have an account of your own. If you wish for them to have full researcher status this must be confirmed by the supervisor to Rebecca directly, not through your student or third party. To handle the day-to-day needs of your own students: Ensure that you have the knowledge to know how to implement designs you expect your students to use through the site. To check the standards of your students work. To approve “student” researcher status of your own students. To activate the projects of your own students, even when they deactivate them by making edits after an initial activation. To manage your students expectations of what the site can provide (it will not be perfect or even workable for some types of study). Supervisors should supervise their own students’ accounts only, unless they have the expertise to double-check the veracity of the students’ work and are prepared to accept the responsibilities outlined above for these students. Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that their students have the status that they require to carry out their projects. This includes assigning them sufficient permissions to construct and deploy their studies. Once the supervisor has “researcher” status they will have a new area of the website opened to them, accessible through the researchers’ link in the menu on the right, which will contain a section called “Admin”: Clicking on this button will take them to a page with more options. To see and make changes to the privileges of those who have requested you as a supervisor and requested researcher status select the option “Supervision” from the menu. Here you will see a list of individuals who have requested you as a supervisor. To change their status, select the appropriate account type from the right-most drop-down menu under the column “Status”. The account you are making changes to will have to log out and back in again to be updated with their new permissions. When you press “Send” an email will be sent to the student to inform them of the status change. If you are a supervising member of teaching or research staff, you should request Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as your supervisor. More senior students who are relatively self-sufficient or have their own supervising duties may request “researcher” accounts if you, their supervisor, agrees to it and contacts Rebecca about it directly. No such request will be accepted on the word of a student or request via third party. In such a case where this is agreed they should request Lisa or Rebecca as their supervisor as any other “researcher” account would. Activating Studies Once you activate a study for a “student” researcher account it cannot be edited without resetting it back to “test” status, essentially deactivating it. Students should confirm that they are completely happy with the study before they ask you to activate it. If a student makes a change to the study after activation, rendering it inactive, you the supervisor are the point of contact for the student to reactivate it. You may wish to check that the edits made have not changed the quality of the project. Resetting Passwords Researcher status accounts also have permission to reset some passwords, found by searching in the “Participant Data” section in the admin page, but they should limit this to resetting the passwords of their own students or participants. You must be satisfied that the account holder is the person requesting the change of password. In terms of students conducting research projects I would recommend that they present themselves to you in person to request a password change as these students have access to participant data. To change a password, you can either: Navigate to Researchers, then Admin and finally to Participants and search for either the entire or partial username or ID number and click “reset password” or Find your student under your supervisory list by going to Researchers, then Admin, then Supervision and selecting their name from the list and selecting “reset password. The new password will be displayed on the page straight away on the page: This password is supposed to be temporary, but it does not expire. It should be changed as soon as possible as it will have likely be communicated via e-mail or will have been written down. Autologin Links Autologin links allow you to by-pass password verification and access the accounts of those that you supervise. These exist to allow admins and supervisors to log in to student’s accounts to examine their studies and help when required. You can access your student’s autologin link by navigating to “Researchers” &gt; “Admin” &gt; “Supervision” and clicking on the student’s name from your list of supervisees: Clicking on the autologin link will log you into the account of this user which allows you to examine what is going on in their account from the perspective of their account. This should be used for troubleshooting issues such as lack of access to the researchers section of the website and bugs that may be specific to their account or project(s). These links are the same ones that the admins use to examine user accounts. "],
