Lai, Rifah Abdullah, Gaby Mahrholz, Lisa DeBruine 2020-01-13 About Experimentum Getting Support For Experimentum @ University of Glasgow Users Currently there are two active admins available to provide support, these are Rebecca Lai and Professor Lisa DeBruine. Admins play a double role. In addition to helping you with Experimentum we are active researchers and teaching staff with additional jobs to do elsewhere. Our inboxes are often full, and emails will often go unread. As a result of this, all students and staff who are experiencing technical issues should use the Slack workspace “Experimentum-web” to get support. Additionally, we are using the queries on the slack workspace to best update the user documentation, so it is important to keep all correspondence in one neat location. You should never post data on this workspace, either in data file or screenshot form, as this would be a violation of the GDPR. All such files will be removed and your supervisor will be informed. If you need to share your data please use one of the university approved services available to you, such as OneDrive or OwnCloud. Lost Passwords For security reasons we do not allow users to request a password reset automatically. If you are any type of account holder who has lost their password, please contact the admins or your supervisor to ask for it to be reset. This request should only be honoured if sent from the email address associated with the account. A temporary password will be issued, which is case-sensitive, and should be changed as soon as possible. For accounts types which have access to participant data (student &amp; researcher), contact your supervisor or admins. Be prepared to visit with your student card to have your password reset. Changing Your Password You can change your password by signing in, navigating to “My Account” from the menu on the right of the page and clicking the link “change your password” under “Username”: Tutorial Sessions During times of particularly heavy use through the academic year we may schedule specific help sessions to deal with common issues and to help you fix specific problems that you might have. These will be advertised on the Slack workspace and on appropriate Moodle pages. If you are experiencing an issue that is particularly difficult to fix remotely, you can make an appointment with Rebecca via private message on the “Experimentum-web” workspace. However, you should have made attempts to solve the issue remotely first as time available for these appointments is extremely limited. If you require assistance to navigate this document or create your study due to disability please contact your supervisor who may refer you to the admins. For Other Users If you download and use the code for this online psychology study platform you should establish clear guidelines outlining the role of the admins and methods of support. Staff from the University of Glasgow will not provide support for users of other systems based upon this code. Our Slack workspace is for internal use only. If you find an issue with the Experimentum codebase, please file an issue here. If you find an issue with the codebase for this manual you can file an issue here. Privacy Notices Cookies Cookies are used for Experimentum to allow us to track user sessions, which allows participants to navigate between pages during a session without having to log in to every page. In the case of anonymous logins, the session is tracked to maintain the same identity across multiple elements of the same study. Cookies are not tracked beyond a single session, for either registered users or anonymous participants. By closing the browser, the current session is ended, and cookies tracking the session are discarded. Cookies are not used in any other way by us, and the information is not retained or shared with any other organisations. Data Management Your study’s data is your responsibility. Please ensure that it is protected and used appropriately. University of Glasgow guidelines with regard to data protection are available to view here and more general data management guidelines here. Experimentum saves your data to the University of Glasgow School of Psychology secure servers, which are on-site in Hillhead Street. Data will be output in Comma Separated Variable (.csv) files in “tidy” format and is available for download from your project or from each component of your study. Whilst data processing questions should be directed to your supervisor(s) and advisors, there are a couple of common tasks that you might find yourself needing to do. See the examples in the section Commonly used R code for help with some common code segments. About your data With all account types, besides anonymous participation, your user ID is linked to the data that you submit. This allows us to track users in multi-part studies, but it also means that our servers will contain multiple bits of information about you built up through your participation. Individual researchers will only be able to access the data that you submit on their studies, and not data you submit to studies belonging to other researchers. In real terms, this means that individual researchers will only see the data that you give to them, not the data that you give across the entire site. In cases where you participate in multiple studies for the same researcher, they will be able to see your data across these studies. Individual researchers are responsible for the protection of your privacy, ensuring that there is no way for any third party to use this information to “triangulate” your identity using the information you have provided. If you have any concerns about how your data is used please contact the researchers involved in the study or studies that you are taking/have taken part in. To see the University’s guidelines on how researchers should treat data see here. You have rights concerning your own data and how it is used, and responsible researchers should always hold these in the highest regard. Consent Upon registration, users are asked to complete a standardised consent form: When constructing studies, you should also include your own consent form, including all relevant information specified by your supervisor(s) and regulatory body relevant to your work. Codebase Open code for the site and installation instructions are available to download here. This is provided under a CC-BY-SA 3.0 license. The same is provided for this user guide here, and under this same license. This document was authored using bookdown (Xie 2019).

["accounts.html", "Chapter 2 User Accounts 2.1 Overview 2.2 Account Types 2.3 Registration Process 2.4 Requesting Researcher Status 2.5 Checking your account status 2.6 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests", " Chapter 2 User Accounts 2.1 Overview There are several account types that you can have with Experimentum, each with its own purpose and different levels of privileges. This chapter explains what account types exist, what they do, which type of account you might want to have and how to change account types for supervisors. 2.2 Account Types 2.2.1 “Guest” Accounts For participants who are not required to have an account. You do not need to be signed in but you can still take part in some experiments on the site. When you close your browser, this account is discarded and no longer tracked. This allows for anonymous participation in some experiments. If a guest participant closes their browser mid-way through a study their progress will not be saved and the data will read as an incomplete run. As guest users do not have a profile, we do not store their age, gender or any other types of information about them. We suggest that you do not place age or gender restrictions on studies where participants take part anonymously as guests. When guests sign into a study with age or gender restrictions, they will see a dialogue box asking them for their age and gender. This information is used to prevent those who should not take part from taking part and inserted into the user information in the downloaded data files. If you need to collect further demographic information, we suggest constructing a demographics questionnaire component. 2.2.2 “Registered” Accounts These accounts are for participants. You have created an account and given us your date of birth and gender identification. You can participate in studies on the site. Your participation record is tracked, meaning that you can be linked across multiple-part studies. Under no circumstances should you be linked across multiple studies without your explicit permission, we will never use data to “triangulate” your identity. Researchers can only access your data from their own studies, not the studies of other researchers. 2.2.3 “Student” Accounts For students who are conducting research as part of a mini project, undergraduate dissertation, master’s or doctoral thesis. To create and run studies you must first register and then request researcher status. Your supervisor will be the person who changes your account status and you can check the status of your account by looking at your account info. When approved, students will be given “student” status, a special type of research account. You may still use this account to participate in experiments, but we advise setting up a separate registered, non-research account for participation to prevent serious data submissions from being removed by other investigators. 2.2.4 “Researcher” Accounts For staff, more senior students and anyone who may be supervising students using Experimentum. Follow the instructions for students as above, but staff should set either Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as their supervisor, who will grant them “researcher” status. If you plan on supervising students using Experimentum you should set up a researcher account to be able to oversee the construction of their studies, share components and change studies to “active” before data collection can begin. When you have established your researcher account your name will appear in the list of potential supervisors for students to choose from. 2.2.5 “Test” Accounts For students and staff. This account type gives you the same amount of privileges as the registered account for participants, but any data collected from these accounts is saved in data sets with a status of “test”. This allows you and other test accounts to try out your study and easily identify and filter out which data should be excluded from the analysis. If you wish to have a test account contact an admin to set this up. 2.2.6 “Admin” Accounts For staff who assist others constructing and managing their studies online. This is the highest level of access. An admin account basically allows us to “supervise” all users, including researcher accounts. We use this to see what is happening when problems arise to help provide aid, not to take responsibility for approval of status changes of students or oversee the design or activation of studies. 2.3 Registration Process In order to sign up to the site you will select “Sign up” on the top right-hand side of the page. Once there you will be taken to a new page as below and asked to create a username, set a password and confirm it, provide your gender identity and birthday. Completing these steps alone will create a “registered” account type. With this account type you can participate in studies on the site. Your participation record is tracked, meaning that you can be linked across multiple-part studies. Under no circumstances will you be linked across multiple studies without your explicit permission and we will never use data to “triangulate” your identity. Researchers and students can only access your data from their own studies, not the studies of others. 2.4 Requesting Researcher Status If you are a researcher or a student who is using the site to conduct a research project (such as a mini or maxi project, or an MSc or PhD thesis) you will need to request permission to construct and conduct studies. If you are a supervising member of teaching staff, you will also need to have an account in order to supervise your students project. On the registration page, or the account page if you have already registered, there is a “Request Researcher Status” button. When you click on this additional fields will appear that you will need to fill in, as below. You will need to provide us with your name, your email address and your supervisor. You should use your university email address to sign up and provide your real name so that your supervisor can more easily identify you. If you are a student conducting a research project you should select the member of staff supervising your project from the drop-down menu of supervisors. If you are a supervising member of teaching or research staff, you should request Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as your supervisor. If you are a more senior student who is relatively self-sufficient or you have supervising duties of your own, and your supervisor agrees to it, you can also request Lisa or Rebecca as your supervisor, and we will set you as a “researcher” account type. As a general rule, all students completing a research project should be assigned “student” status. Some PhD students may be better off with “researcher” status. Such individuals should speak to their supervisors and the admins to determine which is the best account type for them. 2.5 Checking your account status When you first sign up your account will be the “registered” type and will remain as such until your researcher status is approved. You can check on the status of your account by selecting “account” from the menu on the right-hand side of the page. Underneath the “My Information” section of the page will tell you your date of registration, number of logins and current account type. The menu on the right also changes when you have been granted researcher status, with a new option of “Researchers” available which takes you to the study creation area of the site. If there is a delay in accepting your request you should contact your supervisor directly and not the admin staff. It is the responsibility of the supervisor to make changes to your access level. If your supervisor is experiencing technical difficulties in accepting your request, they should contact the admins directly themselves. Admins will not respond to a student who is requesting help on behalf of their supervisor. 2.6 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that their students have the status that they require to carry out their projects. This includes assigning them sufficient permissions to construct and deploy their studies. Once the supervisor has “researcher” status they will have a new area of the website opened to them, accessible through the researchers’ link in the menu on the right, which will contain a section called “Admin”: Clicking on this button will take them to a page with more options. To see and make changes to the privileges of those who have requested you as a supervisor and requested researcher status select the option “Supervision” from the menu. Here you will see a list of individuals who have requested you as a supervisor. To change their status, select the appropriate account type from the right-most drop-down menu under the column “Status”. The account you are making changes to will have to log out and back in again to be updated with their new permissions. When you press “Send” an email will be sent to the student to inform them of the status change. "],

If there is anything missing please file an issue on the GitHub codebase for this book by clicking here. 10.2 Approving Student and Researcher Status Requests Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure that their students have the status that they require to carry out their projects. This includes assigning them sufficient permissions to construct and deploy their studies. Once the supervisor has “researcher” status they will have a new area of the website opened to them, accessible through the researchers’ link in the menu on the right, which will contain a section called “Admin”: Clicking on this button will take them to a page with more options. To see and make changes to the privileges of those who have requested you as a supervisor and requested researcher status select the option “Supervision” from the menu. Here you will see a list of individuals who have requested you as a supervisor. To change their status, select the appropriate account type from the right-most drop-down menu under the column “Status”. The account you are making changes to will have to log out and back in again to be updated with their new permissions. When you press “Send” an email will be sent to the student to inform them of the status change. If you are a supervising member of teaching or research staff, you should request Lisa DeBruine or Rebecca Lai as your supervisor. More senior students who are relatively self-sufficient or have their own supervising duties may request “researcher” accounts if you, their supervisor, agrees to it. In such a case they should request Lisa or Rebecca as thier supervisor. 10.3 Resetting Passwords Researcher status accounts also have permission to reset some passwords, found by searching in the “Participant Data” section in the admin page, but they should limit this to resetting the passwords of their own students or participants. You must be satisfied that the account holder is the person that is requesting the change of password. In terms of students conducting research projects I would recommend that they present themselves to you in person to request a password change as these students have access to participant data. To change a password, you can either: Navigate to Researchers, then Admin and finally to Participants and search for either the entire or partial username or ID number and click “reset password”. Find your student under your supervisory list by going to Researchers, then Admin, then Supervision and selecting their name from the list and selecting “reset password. The new password will be displayed on the page straight away on the page: This password is supposed to be temporary, but it does not expire. It should be changed as soon as possible as it will have likely be communicated via e-mail or will have been written down. 10.4 Autologin Links Autologin links allow you to by-pass password verification and access the accounts of those that you supervise. These exist to allow admins and supervisors to log in to student’s accounts to examine their studies and help when required. You can access your student’s autologin link by navigating to “Researchers” &gt; “Admin” &gt; “Supervision” and clicking on the student’s name from your list of supervisees: Clicking on the autologin link will log you into the account of this user which allows you to examine what is going on in their account from the perspective of their account. This should be used for troubleshooting issues such as lack of access to the researchers section of the website and bugs that may be specific to their account. These links are the same ones that the admins use to examine user accounts. "],
